# OFF: Outwit or Fall Flat

## Introduction

Created by Kaleb Hui, Luka Rogic, Sam Gu and Ting Xu, OFF: Outwit or Fall Flat is a two player online platforming game where the objective is to beat the level as fast as possible! The project consists of a custom built game console used to input actions through a keyboard and display the game on a VGA monitor. Our team also designed  the game and hosted it on a remote server for users to play remotely.

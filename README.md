# OFF: OUTWIT or FALL FLAT

## Introduction

Created by Kaleb Hui, Luka Rogic, Sam Gu and Ting Xu, Outwit or Fall Flat (OFF) is a two player online platforming game where the objective is to beat the level as fast as possible! The project consists of a custom built game console used to input actions through a keyboard and output data on to a VGA monitor. We also designed the game and hosted it on a remote server for users to play remotely.
